\chapter{Project Proposal}\label{app:an}

Include the project propsal, without the literature planner.

For PDFs, a good way to include them is to have a figure (not included in toc with *) of the first page.
Then include all the other pages using pdfpages package. Using the figure first allows for the headers to
match correctly.

% This includes it onto the first page
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \begin{singlespace}
%         \centering
%         \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Back_Matter/ProposalPg1.png}
%     \end{singlespace}
% \end{figure}

% This nicely joins the PDF after the appendix page. (exclude first page using tool like ilovepdf)
%\includepdf[pages=-]{Back_Matter/Proposal.pdf}

\chapter{Logbook Summary Signature Sheet}\label{app:another}

This is another Appendix, namely Appendix~\ref{app:another}. This appendix
should be your Logbook Summary Signature Sheet, template can be found in information booklet on moodle.

\chapter{Another Appendix}

After the other two, the main idea is to place anything that doesn't fit nicely into the flow of your report. Things like code and schematics.
